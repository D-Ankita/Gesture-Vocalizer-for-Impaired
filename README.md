# Gesture-Vocalizer-for-Impaired
This mini project report titled “Gesture Vocalizer for Impaired” by  Divya Chouhan, Dharmik Desai and Ankita Dodamani fulfills the required Project Work towards the degree of Third Year of Engineering in Information Technology.
Gesture Vocalizer for Speech Impaired is a device that can be used for various purposes such as communication, health monitoring, gaming and many more. The medium through which we can communicate with deaf and dumb people is sign language. It is a non-verbal form of interaction which is found among deaf communities in the world. We designed a Gesture Vocalizer that will make the sign language understandable to everyone. Deaf-mute people can easily communicate using this glove. This project converts Sign to text and also text to speech (basic commands) which can be delivered through devices like speakers, watches, neck pieces etc. The basic idea is to synthesize speech to audio using a speaker. 
The glove is equipped with flex sensors, an accelerometer which is further connected to AVR Atmega16, IC AP8942A speech synthesizer. Serial Monitor of Arduino IDE is used to display result on the basis of specific gestures. Gesture Vocalizer for Speech Impaired decreases the communication barrier between two different communities and they will be able to communicate easily with the normal person. For this, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) to achieve the above objective
